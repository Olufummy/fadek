      <h2>Letter of Apology</h2>
      <p>If meeting me was the Worst thing in your life, I’m truly sorry, it was never my intention to cause you pain or regret my hope always bring joy support and positivity into your world not to add to your struggles, if I fall short of that and caused so many distress. It weighs heavily on me. 
        I understand that life can be unpredictable and sometimes despite our best efforts things don’t turnout as planned, if Our time together has brought you more hurt than Happiness, I  deeply regret it, Please know that my feelings for you were genuine and the last thing I want was to be a source of anguish in your life. All I can do now is offer my sincere apology and hope for your forgiveness. I wish for you to find peace and healing and if there’s anything I can do to make amends, please let me know.
        My goal was to be a positive influence and I’m sorry if I failed to be that for you.</p>
